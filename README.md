# Probabilistic Parsing using Viterbi CYK Decoder

**Author:** Raiyan Abdul Baten

This project was done as part of a homework in the CSC448 Statistical Speech and Language Processing course at the University of Rochester.


## Usage Instruction

To run the program, simply use the following commands:

(a)
```
python3 parser.py weights test
```
(b)
```
python3 perceptron.py train weights.trained
```


## Acknowledgment
I took help from this set of slides, where the weighted CYK algorithm is explained nicely:
